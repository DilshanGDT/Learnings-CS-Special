Your Company, ABC Company Ltd, is an established software development organization that has been using traditional waterfall project management methodologies for many years. An external team had been utilized to investigate the challenges encountered by ABC Company, its project management approach, and the resulting outcomes. Objectives of the investigation are:

- To understand challenges faced in software development projects.
- To analyze the adoption of classical project management methodologies.
- To evaluate the impact of traditional waterfall project management on project success metrics
- To highlight the key lessons learned and best practices derived.

The proposed methodology is listed below:  
a) Gathering information from project teams.  
b) Analysis of project documentation.  
c) Examination of project metrics.

### ***Questions:***

#### i. Define project teams the investigation team refers to in **1. a)**. 
The "project teams" in this context refer to the groups of individuals within ABC Company who are directly involved in software development projects. These teams typically include:

1. **Development Team** – Programmers, testers, and technical staff responsible for coding and implementation.
2. **Project Management Team** – Project managers, scrum masters (if applicable), and coordinators overseeing timelines and deliverables.
3. **Stakeholders** – Business analysts, clients, and sponsors defining requirements and expectations.
4. **Quality Assurance (QA) Team** – Engineers ensuring adherence to quality standards.

#### ii. List the communication methods to be used to gather information from each of the members identified in **Q1 i**. **[06 marks]**
1. **Surveys/Questionnaires** – For structured feedback from large groups (e.g., developers).
2. **Interviews** – One-on-one discussions with project managers or stakeholders for in-depth insights.
3. **Focus Groups** – Collaborative sessions with QA teams to identify recurring issues.
4. **Document Review Meetings** – Formal meetings with analysts to clarify requirements.
5. **Observation** – Shadowing development teams during sprints or testing phases.
6. **Email/Feedback Forms** – Asynchronous communication for remote or busy members.

#### iii. Tabulate the project documents that can be used for **1. b)** with all the information you wish to extract from each document along with their purpose. **[08 marks]**
| **Project Document**           | **Information Retrieved**                    | **Purpose**                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Charter**            | Scope, objectives, stakeholders, timelines.  | Understand project goals and alignment with business needs.          |
| **Requirement Specifications** | Functional/non-functional requirements.      | Verify completeness and clarity of initial requirements.             |
| **Test Plans**                 | QA strategies, test cases, defect logs.      | Evaluate testing rigor and identify gaps in quality control.         |
| **Progress Reports**           | Milestones achieved, delays, resource usage. | Assess adherence to timelines and efficiency of resource allocation. |

#### iv. What are the project metrics you suggest investigating here under **1. c)**? **[04 marks]**
1. **Schedule Variance (SV)** – Measures timeline deviations.
2. **Cost Variance (CV)** – Tracks budget overruns.
3. **Defect Density** – Number of bugs per module/phase.
4. **Customer Satisfaction Scores** – Post-delivery feedback on deliverables.

#### v. List down five (05) challenges you believe to be faced by the Company when adopting classical waterfall approach. **[05 marks]**
1. **Inflexibility** to changing requirements mid-project.
2. **Late defect detection** due to delayed testing phases.
3. **Poor stakeholder engagement** after the requirements phase.
4. **Scope creep** from uncontrolled requirement expansions.
5. **Long delivery cycles** delaying ROI realization.

#### vi. As one of the findings, the investigation group reports **scope creep**. Scope creep refers to the uncontrolled expansion or gradual growth of a project's scope beyond its original boundaries and agreed-upon requirements. Discuss how and why it can happen while adopting the waterfall approach. **[05 marks]**
- **How**:
    1. Stakeholders request additions after the requirements phase.
    2. Ambiguous initial requirements lead to misinterpretations.

- **Why**:    
    1. Lack of iterative reviews (unlike Agile).
    2. Contractual rigidity forces changes to be absorbed rather than negotiated.

#### vii. Incorporating quality assurance activities throughout the project lifecycle was also highlighted as a recommendation. Discuss the importance of this in both classical-waterfall and agile methods.
- **Waterfall**: QA at the end risks costly late-stage fixes. Early QA integration reduces rework.  
- **Agile**: Continuous QA ensures iterative improvements and aligns with evolving requirements.

#### viii. Suggest the main risks that are involved while adopting static modules like classical waterfall, which can be eradicated by adopting Agile practices.
1. **Risk of outdated deliverables** – Agile’s iterations ensure relevance.
2. **Poor stakeholder communication** – Daily standups and sprints improve transparency.
3. **High rework costs** – Early testing reduces defect accumulation.
