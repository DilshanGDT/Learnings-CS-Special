2. **Project Portfolio Management** 
    Overview of all the projects that an organization undertakes or is considering,
	
	- Identify which project proposals are worth implementing.
	- Assessing the amount of risk of failure that a potential project has.
	- How to share limited resources.
	- Dependencies between projects.
	- Ensuring that projects do not duplicate work.
	- Ensuring that necessary developments have not been missed 
	
3. **Main 3 aspects of PPM**
    
- ##### a. Portfolio Definition - a centralized single repository that records all details of an organization's current projects, helping in strategic decision-making.
    
| Key Aspect    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope         | Includes both ICT and non-ICT projects for holistic oversight.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Project Types | NPD (New Product Development): Focused on market-driven goods/services with measurable revenue.<br>Renewal Projects: Updates to existing systems (e.g., IT infrastructure); higher risk due to irregular execution. |
| Purpose       | Ensures strategic alignment, resource optimization, and risk management.                                                                                                                                            |
	
- ##### b. Portfolio Management - involves the centralized management of project portfolios to align with strategic objectives and maximize value.
	
| Key Aspect               | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detailed Costing         | Tracks all project expenses (resources, time, budget) for accurate financial oversight. |
| Expected Value Tracking  | Records projected benefits (ROI, strategic alignment) that managers anticipate.         |
| Performance Monitoring   | Measures actual outcomes against forecasts to identify gaps/successes.                  |
| Future Project Screening | Uses historical data to evaluate and prioritize new project proposals rigorously.       |
	
- *Key Benefits*
    
	- Financial Control - Ensures cost-effective resource allocation.
	- Strategic Alignment - Prioritizes projects that deliver the most value.
	- Data-Driven Decisions - Leverages past performance to improve future project selection.
	
- ##### c. Portfolio Optimization - focuses on selecting, prioritizing, and allocating resources to projects in a way that best achieves strategic goals and balances risk and return.
    
| Project Type            | Characteristics                             | Strategic Role                           | Real-World Example                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Risk, High-Profit  | Big potential rewards but high uncertainty. | Fuels innovation and market disruption.  | Startup launching AI-powered healthcare tech.                               |
| Low-Risk, Steady-Return | Reliable outcomes with modest gains.        | Funds operations and reduces volatility. | Bank upgrading its online payment system.                                   |
| Balanced Mix            | Blends both to hedge risks while growing.   | Optimizes long-term success.             | Tech giant investing in both R&D (risky) and cloud infrastructure (stable). |
	
- ==Key Rule== ▶ Don’t put all eggs in one basket – Allocate 70% to steady projects, 20% to strategic risks, 10% to moonshots.
	
4. **Project Evaluation** 
    
	- A systematic assessment to determine whether a project is worth pursuing by analyzing its costs, benefits, and alignment with strategic goals.
	
| Aspect                  | Description                                                        | Example                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost-Benefit Validation | Ensures financial and operational benefits outweigh costs.         | A new CRM system increases sales by 20% while reducing support costs.            |
| Strategic Alignment     | Check if the project supports long-term organizational objectives. | An AI automation project aligns with the company’s digital transformation goals. |
| Feasibility             | Assesses technical, operational, and timeline viability.           | Migrating to cloud infrastructure within 6 months with available IT resources.   |
| Risk Assessment         | Evaluates potential challenges (financial, technical, market).     | A new e-commerce platform faces cybersecurity risks but has mitigation plans.    |
	
5. **Problems in Project Portfolio Management**
	
	- Full-time staff can be effectively part-time on projects due to shared responsibilities.
	- Excluding projects distorts the true picture of organizational activities.
	- Non-portfolio activities can drain resources and misalign priorities despite potential benefits.
