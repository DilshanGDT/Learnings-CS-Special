*Calculations:*

1. **Net Profit (Undiscounted):**
    
    - **Project 1:** 
$$
	     −5+3+3+4+4+5 = Rs.14M
$$
	- **Project 2:** 
$$
		-8 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 10 = Rs. 24M
$$
        
2. **Payback Period:**
    - **Project 1:** 
	    - Recovers initial Rs. 5M by **Year 2** 
		    - Rs. 3M in Y1 + Rs. 3M in Y2.
    - **Project 2:** 
	    - Recovers Rs. 8M by **Year 3** 
		    - Rs. 2M + Rs. 5M + Rs. 5M.
        
3. **Return on Investment (ROI):**
$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\frac{\text{Net Profit}}{Project Duration}}{\text{Investment}} \times 100$$
    - **Project 1:** 
    $$\frac{\frac{14}{5}}{5}×100=56\\% $$
    - **Project 2:**
$$
	\frac{\frac{24}{5}}{8} \times 100 = 60
$$

4. **Net Present Value (NPV) at 10%:**
    - **Project 1:**
        $$−5+(3×0.91)+(3×0.83)+(4×0.75)+(4×0.68)+(5×0.62)=Rs.9.0497M$$

    - **Project 2:**        $$−8+(2×0.91)+(5×0.83)+(5×0.75)+(10×0.68)+(10×0.62)=Rs.14.74M$$
*Recommendation:*
**Project 2** is more viable due to:
- Higher NPV (**Rs. 14.74M** vs. Rs. 9.04M).
- Greater net profit (**Rs. 24M** vs. Rs. 14M).
- Better ROI (**60%** vs. 56%).  
    Despite a longer payback period (3 years vs. 2), its long-term benefits outweigh Project 1.

#### Q2. a. Assume that there is a government-proposed loan scheme to help farmers start greenhouse farming with the support of modern technology. The probability of the government passing the loan scheme is 0.3 and the scheme not being approved is 0.7. If the company decides to implement the new greenhouse automation system and if the market expands due to the loan scheme, the company could make a net profit of 32 million. If the loan scheme is not approved and the market does not expand, the company will make a net profit of -8 million (the cost of development of the system). If they do not develop the new greenhouse management system and still use an old system they have, and if the market expands due to the loan scheme, the company could make a net profit of -20 million. If the loan scheme is not approved and the market does not expand, the company will make a net profit of 12.5 million. Use a Decision Tree to perform the risk evaluation of the project and calculate the Net Profit if the market expands and if it does not. 

To evaluate the risk and profitability of the project using a **Decision Tree**, we will consider the **two possible decisions**:
1. **Implement the new greenhouse automation system**
2. **Do not implement the new system (stick with the old system)**

For each decision, there are two possible **states of nature** based on whether the **loan scheme is approved** (market expands) or **not approved** (market does not expand).

###### Step 1: Define Probabilities
- **P(Loan Approved / Market Expands) = 0.3**
- **P(Loan Not Approved / Market Does Not Expand) = 0.7**    
###### Step 2: Outcomes

| Decision                          | Market Expands (0.3) | Market Doesn't Expand (0.7) |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Implement New System**          | +32 million          | -8 million                  |
| **Do Not Implement (Old System)** | -20 million          | +12.5 million               |
###### Step 3: *Expected Monetary Value (EMV)*
We compute **EMV** for each decision:

A. Implement New System
$$
\text{EMV}_{\text{new}} = (0.3 \times 32) + (0.7 \times -8) = 9.6 - 5.6 = \mathbf{4 \text{ million}}
$$

 B. Do Not Implement New System
$$
\text{EMV}_{\text{old}} = (0.3 \times -20) + (0.7 \times 12.5) = -6 + 8.75 = \mathbf{2.75 \text{ million}}
$$
###### Step 4: Decision Tree Summary
```
                          [Decision]
                           /     \
                          /       \
             [New System]         [Old System]_______
              /      \              /                \
     Market Expands  No Expansion  Market Expands  No Expansion
      (0.3, +32M)    (0.7, -8M)     (0.3, -20M)     (0.7, +12.5M)

EMV = 4M                          EMV = 2.75M
```

---
#### c. How would you apply the bottom-up approach for the above work breakdown structure in 2(b) to perform a software effort estimation? (Assume that lowest-level tasks take 2-3 weeks to complete).

- **Break down the project into smallest tasks**  
    → 25 lowest-level tasks identified (e.g., 2.2.1, 2.4.2, etc.)
    
- **Estimate effort per task**  
    → Each task takes **2–3 weeks**. Use **average = 2.5 weeks**.
    
- **Calculate total effort**  
    → 25 tasks × 2.5 weeks = **62.5 person-weeks**
    
- **Distribute by phase**
    - Planning: 10 weeks
    - Design & Dev: 25 weeks
    - Testing: 10 weeks
    - Deployment: 10 weeks
    - Support: 7.5 weeks
    
- **Estimate duration with team**  
    → With 5 people: 62.5 ÷ 5 = **~12.5 weeks total**

#### d. Given below is a table of activities. Construct a Precedence Network and identify the critical path of the project.

| C        | A          | 2                                              | 3                    |              |
| D        | B          | 8                                              | 10                   |              |
| E        | C, D       | 3                                              | 5                    |              |
| F        | -          | 13                                             | 17                   |              |

#### ✅ **Step 1: Calculate Comfort Zones**

Comfort Zone (CZ) = Pessimistic Time – Most Likely Time

|Activity|Most Likely ($T_m$)|Pessimistic ($T_p$)|**Comfort Zone (CZ)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|10|12|2|
|B|7|9|2|
|C|2|3|1|
|D|8|10|2|
|E|3|5|2|
|F|13|17|4|
|G|6|8|2|
|H|11|14|3|

---

#### ✅ **Step 2: Calculate Feeding Buffers**

A **Feeding Buffer** is **half the total comfort zone** of **non-critical chain paths feeding into the critical chain**.

**Critical Chain: A → B → D → E → G → H**

Non-critical tasks:

- **C** feeds into E
- **F** feeds into G

So we calculate feeding buffers for:

1. **C → E path:**
    
    - C's CZ = 1
    - E is on the critical chain → No CZ counted
	    - *Feeding Buffer = ½ × total CZ of tasks in the non-critical path (before joining critical chain)*
    - **Feeding Buffer** = ½ × 1 = 0.5 → *round up* → 1 week
    
2. **F → G path:**
    
    - F's CZ = 4
    - G is on the critical chain → not counted
    - **Feeding Buffer = ½ × 4 = 2 weeks**

|Path|Feeding Buffer|
|---|---|
|C → E|1 week|
|F → G|2 weeks|

#### *Feeding Buffer = ½ × Total Comfort Zone of the Entire Path* -> if the 2 activities are not in the critical chain 

---

#### ✅ **Step 3: Project Buffer**

Project buffer = **½ × sum of CZs on the critical chain**

Critical chain activities and their CZs:

- A: 2
    
- B: 2
    
- D: 2
    
- E: 2
    
- G: 2
    
- H: 3  
    → Total CZ = 13
    

**Project Buffer = ½ × 13 = 6.5 → round up → 7 weeks**

---

#### ✅ **Step 4: Gantt Chart (Critical Chain View)**

**Baseline: Critical Chain Tasks with Most Likely Durations**

|Task|Duration (T_m)|Start|End|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|10|0|10|
|B|7|10|17|
|D|8|17|25|
|E|3|25|28|
|G|6|28|34|
|H|11|34|45|
|**Project Buffer**|7|**45**|**52**|

**Add Feeding Buffers:**

- **C** starts at week 10 (after A), duration 2, finishes at 12  
    → C → E path feeds into E (which starts at 25), so **FB = 1 week**
    
- **F** starts at 0, duration 13, ends at 13  
    → F → G (G starts at 28), **FB = 2 weeks**

### ✅ Final Output Summary

| Type                 | Value                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Comfort Zones**    | Computed for all tasks              |
| **Feeding Buffers**  | C → E: 1 week, F → G: 2 weeks       |
| **Project Buffer**   | 7 weeks                             |
| **Project Duration** | 52 weeks (including project buffer) |

#### b. Using Project 1 as the case, provide one example for each type of quality management cost. 

##### 1. Prevention Costs
- **Example:** Conducting **training sessions for developers and QA teams** on secure coding practices and e-commerce best practices to avoid defects (e.g., payment gateway vulnerabilities or UI/UX flaws).
- _Rationale:_ Investing in training reduces the likelihood of errors in development, improving overall system quality.
##### 2. Appraisal Costs
- **Example:** Performing **automated and manual testing** (e.g., security penetration testing, usability testing, and payment gateway integration checks) before launch.
- _Rationale:_ Testing ensures defects are caught early before the system goes live.
##### 3. Internal Failure Costs
- **Example:** Fixing **a bug in the shopping cart functionality** discovered during testing that causes incorrect order totals.
- _Rationale:_ This cost arises from defects detected before deployment, requiring rework.
##### 4. External Failure Costs
- **Example:** Addressing **a security breach post-launch** where customer payment data is compromised, leading to refunds, legal fines, and reputational damage.
- _Rationale:_ These costs occur when defects reach customers, resulting in financial and brand losses.

#### c. Project 2 would involve both hardware and software procurement. It may also involve procuring external services. Considering the duration of the project, provide an expert judgement to develop a tentative procurement plan. 

##### 1. Procurement Planning (Month 1-2)
**Objective:** Define procurement needs, identify suppliers, and establish contracts.
- ***Conduct Market Research:*** Identify vendors for sensors, controllers, and automation hardware (e.g., IoT devices, nutrient dosing systems).
- ***Software & Licensing:*** Determine if third-party software (e.g., cloud platforms, analytics tools) is needed or if in-house development is preferable.
- ***External Services:*** Assess need for consultants (e.g., agronomists for crop-specific logic, IoT security experts).
- ***Risk Assessment:*** Evaluate supplier reliability, lead times, and alternative sources.

**Procurement Deliverables:**
- Approved vendor list (AVL)
- RFPs (Request for Proposals) for hardware/software
- Contracts for external services

##### 2. Hardware Procurement (Month 3-5)
**Objective:** Secure critical hardware components with long lead times.

    - Third-party APIs (weather data, crop growth algorithms)
- ***External Services:***
    - Hire agronomy consultants for crop-specific automation logic.
    - Contract IoT security auditors to ensure data protection.
***Considerations*:**
- Opt for scalable subscriptions (e.g., pay-as-you-go cloud) to avoid overcommitting.
- Ensure APIs have long-term support to avoid mid-project obsolescence.

##### 4. Final Procurement & Integration (Month 7-9)
**Objective:** Procure remaining components and validate full system integration.
- ***Additional Hardware:***
    - Spare parts for field testing
    - Custom enclosures for outdoor durability
- ***Software Finalization:***
    - Purchase full licenses after successful pilot testing.
    - Procure analytics dashboards for end-users.
- ***Logistics:***
    - Arrange shipping for pilot customer deployments.

##### 5. Post-Procurement & Maintenance (Month 10-12)
**Objective:** Ensure long-term supply chain stability.
- ***Supplier Performance Review:***
    - Assess which vendors met deadlines/quality standards.
- ***Maintenance Contracts:***
    - Secure extended warranties for hardware.
    - Negotiate SLAs (Service-Level Agreements) for cloud services.
- ***Scaling Procurement:***
    - Identify cost reductions for mass production (if commercializing the system).        

##### Procurement Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk**                      | **Mitigation Strategy**                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware delays**           | Order early, maintain backup suppliers.            |
| **Software incompatibility**  | Test APIs/prototypes in sandbox first.             |
| **Supplier bankruptcy**       | Diversify vendors; avoid single-source dependency. |
| **Regulatory non-compliance** | Involve legal experts in procurement contracts.    |

#### d. Briefly explain how you would employ a Project Management Information System in the case of Project 2. 

##### 1. Centralized Planning & Scheduling
- **Gantt Charts & Critical Path:**
    - Map all tasks (hardware procurement, software dev, testing, deployment) with dependencies.
    - Highlight critical paths (e.g., sensor delivery delays could bottleneck testing).
- **Milestone Tracking:**
    - Key deadlines (prototype completion, pilot deployment, final launch) are tracked in real time.

##### 2. Resource & Procurement Management
- **Vendor & Inventory Tracking:**
    - Log lead times, contracts, and delivery status of hardware (sensors, controllers).
    - Trigger alerts if procurement falls behind schedule.
- **Budget Monitoring:**
    - Track costs (hardware purchases, cloud subscriptions, consultant fees) vs. allocated budget.

##### 3. Collaboration & Documentation
- **Cross-Team Coordination:**
    - Hardware engineers, software devs, and agronomists share updates in a unified system.
    - Document testing protocols, compliance checks, and design changes.
- **Risk Register:**
    - Log risks (e.g., sensor supply shortages) and mitigation plans.

##### 4. Real-Time Monitoring & Reporting
- **Dashboards:**
    - Display KPIs (e.g., % of hardware delivered, test pass/fail rates).
- **Automated Alerts:**
    - Notify managers if tasks slip (e.g., delayed firmware updates impact integration).

##### 5. Post-Launch & Maintenance
- **Lessons Learned Database:**
    - Archive procurement delays, testing failures, and solutions for future projects.
- **Maintenance Scheduling:**
    - Plan firmware updates, hardware replacements, and support tickets.
