1. **What is a Project?** 
	- A planned, non-routine activity with specific objectives, time span, and resource constraints.

2. **What is SWPM?**
	- process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources (people, time, budget, tools) to develop software systems efficiently and effectively.
	
3. **Why is Project Management Important?**
    
	- High costs. (A considerable amount of projects run over budget)
	- Most projects are unsuccessful or fail to achieve their goals.
	- The majority of Projects are late. 
	
4. **Characteristics of a Project**
    
	- Non-routine tasks are involved.
	- Planning is required.
	- Specified objectives must be met or a specified product is to be created.
	- Has a pre-determined period.
	- Work involves several specialisms.
	- People are in temporary work groups to carry out tasks.
	- Work is carried out in several phases.
	- Large and complex.
	
5. **Software Projects vs. Other Projects**
    
| Aspect       | Software Projects                      | Other Projects                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Invisibility | Progress not visible until completion. | Progress physically visible.             |
| Complexity   | High per-unit complexity.              | Lower complexity (physical constraints). |
| Conformity   | Adapts to human needs.                 | Follows laws/regulations.                |
| Flexibility  | Easier to change.                      | Harder to change.                        |
	
6. **Contract PM vs. Technical PM**
    
| Aspect         | Contract PM (Client)                    | Technical PM (Supplier)                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Role           | Client-supplier liaison.                | Leads technical execution.                    |
| Decision Focus | Contract & timelines.                   | Tech (tools, architecture).                   |
| Key Tasks      | - Manages contract<br>- Tracks progress | - Manages development<br>- Solves tech issues |
	
7. **Typical Activities of SWPM**
    
	Most Important 3,
	- *Feasibility Study* : Is it worth doing?
	- *Plan* : How do we do it?
	- *Project Execution* : Do it

8. **Categorizing S/W Projects** 
    
| Category                                 | Description                                                            | Example                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compulsory vs. Voluntary Users           | Users are forced (compulsory) or choose (voluntary) to use the system. | Compulsory: Tax filing software (mandatory).<br><br>Voluntary: Social media apps (optional). |
| Information Systems vs. Embedded Systems | Manages data (info) or controls hardware (embedded).                   | Info System: ERP software (SAP).<br><br>Embedded: Car engine control system.                 |
| Objectives vs. Product                   | Goal-driven (objectives) or deliverable-focused (product).             | Objectives: AI research project.<br><br>Product: Mobile app (e.g., WhatsApp).                |
	
9. **Other Managing Stuffs**
    
	- Planning - Defining project goals, scope, schedule, and resources.
	- Organizing - Structuring teams, roles, and workflows for efficient execution.
	- Staffing - Recruiting and assigning skilled personnel to project tasks.
	- Directing - Leading and guiding the team to achieve project objectives.
	- Monitoring - Tracking progress, performance, and adherence to plans.
	- Controlling - Adjusting processes to align with project goals and timelines.
	- Innovating - Implementing new technologies or methods to improve outcomes.
	- Representing - Acting as the liaison between stakeholders and the project team.
