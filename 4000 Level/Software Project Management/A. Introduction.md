1. **What is a Project?** 
	- A planned, non-routine activity with specific objectives, time span, and resource constraints.

2. **What is SWPM?**
	- process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources (people, time, budget, tools) to develop software systems efficiently and effectively.
	
3. **Why is Project Management Important?**
    
	- High costs. (A considerable amount of projects run over budget)
	- Most projects are unsuccessful or fail to achieve their goals.
	- The majority of Projects are late. 
	
4. **Characteristics of a Project**
    
	- Non-routine tasks are involved.
	- Planning is required.
	- Specified objectives must be met or a specified product is to be created.
	- Has a pre-determined period.
	- Work involves several specialisms.
	- People are in temporary work groups to carry out tasks.
	- Work is carried out in several phases.
	- Large and complex.
	
	- ##### Characteristics of a Project
		- Non-routine tasks are involved: Projects involve unique work that isn't part of regular, repetitive operations. Each project tackles specific problems or opportunities that require custom solutions. 
		- Planning is required: All projects need structured planning to define activities, sequence, resources, and timelines before execution can begin effectively. 
		- Specified objectives must be met or a specified product is to be created: Projects have clear, defined goals or deliverables that determine success, whether it's building software, constructing a building, or implementing a new process. 
		- Has a pre-determined time span: Projects have defined start and end dates, distinguishing them from ongoing operations. This temporary nature creates urgency and focus. 
		- Work is for a second party: Projects typically serve stakeholders or clients beyond the implementing team, requiring careful attention to requirements and satisfaction. 
		- Work involves several specialisms: Projects require diverse expertise across multiple disciplines, necessitating collaboration between different professionals. 
		- People are in temporary work groups to carry out tasks: Project teams form specifically for the project duration and disband afterward, creating unique team dynamics. 
		- Work is carried out in several phases: Projects progress through distinct stages (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, closure), each with different activities and focus. 
		- The resources that are available for use are constrained: Projects operate within limitations of budget, time, personnel, and materials, requiring efficient resource management. 
		- Is large and complex: Projects typically involve multiple interrelated components, stakeholders, and activities that must be coordinated, making them more challenging than routine tasks.	
	
5. **Software Projects vs. Other Projects**
    
| Aspect       | Software Projects                      | Other Projects                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Invisibility | Progress not visible until completion. | Progress physically visible.             |
| Complexity   | High per-unit complexity.              | Lower complexity (physical constraints). |
| Conformity   | Adapts to human needs.                 | Follows laws/regulations.                |
| Flexibility  | Easier to change.                      | Harder to change.                        |
	
6. **Contract PM vs. Technical PM**
    
| Aspect         | Contract PM (Client)                    | Technical PM (Supplier)                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Role           | Client-supplier liaison.                | Leads technical execution.                    |
| Decision Focus | Contract & timelines.                   | Tech (tools, architecture).                   |
| Key Tasks      | - Manages contract<br>- Tracks progress | - Manages development<br>- Solves tech issues |
	
7. **Typical Activities of SWPM**
    
	Most Important 3,
	- *Feasibility Study* : Is it worth doing?
	- *Plan* : How do we do it?
	- *Project Execution* : Do it

8. **Categorizing S/W Projects** 
    
| Category                                 | Description                                                            | Example                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compulsory vs. Voluntary Users           | Users are forced (compulsory) or choose (voluntary) to use the system. | Compulsory: Tax filing software (mandatory).<br><br>Voluntary: Social media apps (optional). |
| Information Systems vs. Embedded Systems | Manages data (info) or controls hardware (embedded).                   | Info System: ERP software (SAP).<br><br>Embedded: Car engine control system.                 |
| Objectives vs. Product                   | Goal-driven (objectives) or deliverable-focused (product).             | Objectives: AI research project.<br><br>Product: Mobile app (e.g., WhatsApp).                |
