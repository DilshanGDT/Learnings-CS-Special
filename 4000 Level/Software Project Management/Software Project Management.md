2. **What is SWPM?**
	- process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling resources (people, time, budget, tools) to develop software systems efficiently and effectively.
	
3. **Why is Project Management Important?**
    
	- High costs. (A considerable amount of projects run over budget)
	- Most projects are unsuccessful or fail to achieve their goals.
	- The majority of Projects are late. 
	
4. **Characteristics of a Project**
    
	- Non-routine tasks are involved.
	- Planning is required.
	- Specified objectives must be met or a specified product is to be created.
	- Has a pre-determined period.
	- Work involves several specialisms.
	- People are in temporary work groups to carry out tasks.
	- Work is carried out in several phases.
	- Large and complex.
	
5. **Software Projects vs. Other Projects**
    
| Aspect       | Software Projects                      | Other Projects                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Invisibility | Progress not visible until completion. | Progress physically visible.             |
| Complexity   | High per-unit complexity.              | Lower complexity (physical constraints). |
| Conformity   | Adapts to human needs.                 | Follows laws/regulations.                |
| Flexibility  | Easier to change.                      | Harder to change.                        |
	
6. **Contract PM vs. Technical PM**
    
| Aspect         | Contract PM (Client)                    | Technical PM (Supplier)                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Role           | Client-supplier liaison.                | Leads technical execution.                    |

2. **Project Portfolio Management** 
    Overview of all the projects that an organization undertakes or is considering,
	
	- Identify which project proposals are worth implementing.
	- Assessing the amount of risk of failure that a potential project has.
	- How to share limited resources.
	- Dependencies between projects.
	- Ensuring that projects do not duplicate work.
	- Ensuring that necessary developments have not been missed 
	
3. **Main 3 aspects of PPM**
    
- ##### a. Portfolio Definition - a centralized single repository that records all details of an organization's current projects, helping in strategic decision-making.
    
| Key Aspect    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope         | Includes both ICT and non-ICT projects for holistic oversight.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Project Types | NPD (New Product Development): Focused on market-driven goods/services with measurable revenue.<br>Renewal Projects: Updates to existing systems (e.g., IT infrastructure); higher risk due to irregular execution. |
| Purpose       | Ensures strategic alignment, resource optimization, and risk management.                                                                                                                                            |
	
- ##### b. Portfolio Management - involves the centralized management of project portfolios to align with strategic objectives and maximize value.
	
| Key Aspect               | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detailed Costing         | Tracks all project expenses (resources, time, budget) for accurate financial oversight. |
| Expected Value Tracking  | Records projected benefits (ROI, strategic alignment) that managers anticipate.         |
| Performance Monitoring   | Measures actual outcomes against forecasts to identify gaps/successes.                  |
| Future Project Screening | Uses historical data to evaluate and prioritize new project proposals rigorously.       |
	
- *Key Benefits*
    
	- Financial Control - Ensures cost-effective resource allocation.
	- Strategic Alignment - Prioritizes projects that deliver the most value.
	- Data-Driven Decisions - Leverages past performance to improve future project selection.
	
- ##### c. Portfolio Optimization - focuses on selecting, prioritizing, and allocating resources to projects in a way that best achieves strategic goals and balances risk and return.
    
| Project Type            | Characteristics                             | Strategic Role                           | Real-World Example                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Risk, High-Profit  | Big potential rewards but high uncertainty. | Fuels innovation and market disruption.  | Startup launching AI-powered healthcare tech.                               |
| Low-Risk, Steady-Return | Reliable outcomes with modest gains.        | Funds operations and reduces volatility. | Bank upgrading its online payment system.                                   |
| Balanced Mix            | Blends both to hedge risks while growing.   | Optimizes long-term success.             | Tech giant investing in both R&D (risky) and cloud infrastructure (stable). |
	
- ==Key Rule== ▶ Don’t put all eggs in one basket – Allocate 70% to steady projects, 20% to strategic risks, 10% to moonshots.
	
4. **Project Evaluation** 
    
- A systematic assessment to determine whether a project is worth pursuing by analyzing its costs, benefits, and alignment with strategic goals.
	
| Aspect                  | Description                                                        | Example                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost-Benefit Validation | Ensures financial and operational benefits outweigh costs.         | A new CRM system increases sales by 20% while reducing support costs.            |
| Strategic Alignment     | Check if the project supports long-term organizational objectives. | An AI automation project aligns with the company’s digital transformation goals. |
| Feasibility             | Assesses technical, operational, and timeline viability.           | Migrating to cloud infrastructure within 6 months with available IT resources.   |
| Risk Assessment         | Evaluates potential challenges (financial, technical, market).     | A new e-commerce platform faces cybersecurity risks but has mitigation plans.    |
	
5. **Problems in Project Portfolio Management**
	
	- Full-time staff can be effectively part-time on projects due to shared responsibilities.
	- Excluding projects distorts the true picture of organizational activities.
	- Non-portfolio activities can drain resources and misalign priorities despite potential benefits.
  
#### C. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)
    
1. **What is CBA?**
    
	- Techniques to assess project viability through financial and risk analysis for Identify all of the costs and benefits of carrying out the project and operating the delivered application.
		- Ex - Development cost, Setup cost, Operational cost
    
	- ==All profitable projects cannot be done at the same time hence, we need to do a CBA to select the most profitable.==
    
	- *Costs*
		- Development cost: Hiring software engineers to build the app.
		- Setup cost: Purchasing servers for deployment.
		- Operational cost: Monthly cloud hosting fees.
    
	- *Benefits*
		- Quantified and valued: "$500K annual revenue increase from faster checkout."
		- Quantified but not valued: "Reduces support tickets by 30%."
		- Identified but not quantified/valued: "Improves brand reputation."
    
2. **Cash Flow Forecasting**
    
	- *Cash flow forecast* - Indicates when expenditure and income will take place.
		  
		![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegtXV3IEOjY4rHCnN_MLF2wqPo2yPeUOBFlVX-aeJajDJ9ucFQ1v-mPK-GwUoU5ZFpSSazPxwSNho-5N7ef69CnbrRaY24n3YEgD4aP-cOpuPRVUtvjZUXelS06mZHskeT42yb6Q?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
	
3. **Cash Flow Metrices**
	
|Metric|Definition|Example|Why We Need This Metric|
|---|---|---|---|
|Net Profit|Revenue minus all expenses.|$100K sales − $70K costs = $30K profit.|Shows the actual profitability of a project or the overall portfolio.|
|Payback Period|Time to recover the initial investment.|Recoup $60K in 3 years.|Indicates how quickly the initial investment will be recouped, highlighting the project's liquidity.|
|ROI|Profit percentage relative to cost.|($20K gain / $50K cost) = 40% ROI.|Measures the efficiency of the investment, showing the return generated for every dollar invested.|
|NPV|Future cash flows' value minus initial cost.|NPV = $10K → Project viable.|Determines the present value of all future cash flows, indicating the project's potential to create value.|
|IRR|Break-even discount rate for NPV.|IRR = 15% (beats 10% benchmark).|Represents the rate of return at which the project's NPV is zero, used to compare against a company's cost of capital.|
	
4. **CB Evaluation Techniques**
    
- *Problems of Cash Flows*
    
	- It's not enough to look at the total profit or benefit; the timing of cash inflows and outflows matters.
	    
	- Example: Even if a project looks profitable in the long run, it might struggle with short-term cash flow problems, like not having enough money to pay interest on borrowed money.
	    
	- So, a good evaluation considers when money is needed and when it becomes available.
	
- *Risk Analysis*
	
	- A project might have a positive CBA (benefits > costs), but if it involves high risk (like uncertainty in the market, political instability, or tech failure), it could fail in practice.
	    
	- Evaluating risks means checking how likely things are to go wrong and how serious the impact would be.
	    
	- It helps avoid over-relying on ideal outcomes and prepares for possible failures.
    
- *The Perspective of the Entire Organization*
    
	- A project might benefit one department or function, but harm the overall financial health of the entire organization.
	    
	- So, evaluation should consider:
		- Does the organization have the resources?
		- Will it affect other critical operations?
		- Is it aligned with long-term goals?
    
5. **Risk Evaluation** 
    
	- A systematic process to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks that could impact a project’s success, focusing on both threats (negative risks) and opportunities (positive risks).
		
		- Business Risks - Uncertainty about whether the delivered product/service will be profitable.
		- Technical Risks: Bugs, scalability issues, or integration failures.
		- Operational Risks: Resource shortages or process inefficiencies.
		- Market Risks: Changing customer needs or competitor actions.
		- Financial Risks: Budget overruns or cash flow gaps.
	
6. **Risk Evaluation Techniques** 
    
- *Project Risk Matrix* - Risk, Importance & Likelihood
    
	![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd2MNHWH-R_zATr5k2bKdHNli4sThDodF399zObz1wDsFvxywFsTcsmRR0wmvvAndISrJ2WIO5Z50lFXjRlXRgVomfKmP9YZ1gVLt4So7fkfbJq7ou2AdLF7tO5YoQKkN6K5_MfDA?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
	
	==Likelihood refers to the probability that a specific risk will occur during the project. It’s a key component of risk evaluation, often rated on a scale (e.g., Low/Medium/High or 1-5).==
	
- *Risk and NPV* - When a project is deemed highly risky, a higher discount rate is used (+2% safe project, +5% for a risky project)
	
	![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf7GtVP_oEe2SSn_BE8dROxHQ6F25_WbyOPGPMmUDwx6lPD4kZHPpZIHC4G6fTPh8m8C0cC2jO55m1794rEtgdVTRXQqprRbkXdfWcbQJzo7MnM8j20Qx2ULqnjmdiY9crxmIHk?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
	
	==A CBA considering each possible outcome and estimate the probability and the corresponding value of the outcome  ==
	
- *Risk Profile Analysis*
    
	- This is done by varying each of the parameters that affect cost or benefit to ascertain how sensitive the profit is to each factor (ex. By +/- 5%).
	    
	- Identify which parameters are most important and see how they can be controlled or their effects mitigated.
	    
	- Ex Scenario :
		- Replace Old sales order system : Rumor that a competitor will declare bankruptcy.
			
		- Extending the current system 
			- No expansion NPV 75000
			- Expansion NPV 100000 loss
			
		- Replacing current system
			- No Expansion NPV 50000 loss
			- Expansion NPV 250000
		    
		- Probability Expansion 20%, Not 80%
    
	*Explanation* : This decision involves evaluating two options - extending the current system or replacing it, while considering market rumors (competitor bankruptcy) and expansion probabilities.
	
	Rumor: Competitor’s potential bankruptcy could reduce competition, creating expansion opportunities.
	
	Expansion Probability: 20% chance market expands (aggressive growth).
	
	80% chance no expansion (status quo).
	
	- *Decision tree*
		![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfacwiYkNx12haQkeyH0CJdFDIBbPGIkL49-dHHBaY7xlIR_GwEfT5B1LLDWJnzAFq3r44qBhuG8hylwuX0jBPnttKSoFblXsQVylRsDvwfmr1KkCJq61Qso42bcVKVi_8EdENo?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
	
	Decision 
	- Extend: (75,000 * 0.8 – 100,000 * 0.2) = 40,000 
	- Replace: (250,000 * 0.2 – 50,000 * 0.8) = 10,000
	- Extending the system has a higher expected value (+40Kvs.+10K), but replacement mitigates the risk if expansion occurs.

#### D. Program Management
    
1. **What are Program & Program Management?**
    
	- A *program* is a group of related projects and initiatives managed together to achieve strategic benefits that wouldn’t be possible if managed individually.
	
	  - *Program management* he coordinated management of multiple projects to deliver strategic value, optimize resources, and manage risks across the program.
	
2. **Forms of Programs**
	
| Program Type              | Description                                                          | Example                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Cycle Programmes | Projects within a fixed planning period (e.g., annual budget cycle). | A retail chain’s yearly store upgrades and marketing campaigns. |
| Strategic Programmes      | Projects driving a unified strategic goal.                           | Merging two banks’ IT systems post-acquisition.                 |
| Infrastructure Programmes | Shared infrastructure supporting multiple projects/departments.      | A cloud migration for all company divisions.                    |
| R&D Programmes            | Mix of high-risk and safe projects for innovation.                   | Pharma companies test 10 drug candidates (1-2 may succeed).     |
| Innovative Partnerships   | Cross-organization collaboration on pre-competitive tech.            | Tech giants jointly develop AI ethics frameworks.               |
	
3. **Resource Allocation Management**
    
- *Resource Sharing*
	
	- Pools of resources must be shared between concurrent projects.
	- Ex : Software Developers, database designers, network support staff, systems analysts
	
| Aspect                      | Project Manager                         | Programme Manager                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of Projects          | Manages one project at a time.          | Manages multiple projects simultaneously.            |
| Relationship with Resources | Impersonal (focuses on resource types). | Personal (works closely with skilled resources).     |
| Resource Focus              | Minimizes demand (avoids overuse).      | Maximizes utilization (optimizes shared resources).  |
| Project Similarity          | Projects are dissimilar (unique goals). | Projects are similar (aligned to a common strategy). |
	
4. **Strategic Program Management** 
    
	- Coordinated management of multiple projects to achieve long-term organizational goals.
	-  Ex - Large complex organizations
		
	- Creating a Program with 4 stages...
	
| Stage                | Purpose                             | Key Components                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Programme Mandate | Formalize strategic intent.         | - New capabilities/services.<br><br>- Organizational improvements.<br><br>- Corporate alignment. | "Launch AI-driven customer service to reduce response time by 40% by 2025."    |
| 2. Programme Brief   | Justify investment (business case). | - Vision statement.<br><br>- Benefits & metrics.<br><br>- Risks, costs, timelines.               | "AI implementation costs 1M but will save 300K/year in staffing costs."        |

5. **Preliminary Program Plan**
	
	- A set of related projects and initiatives aimed at achieving strategic business objectives.
		
	- Not usually possible to have an exact plan at the program onset.
	    
	- Would include : 
		- *No Exact Early Plan* – Programs are complex, so detailed planning happens gradually.
		- *Project Portfolio* – List of projects under the program.
		- *Cost Estimates – Rough budget for each project.
		-  *Expected Benefits – Goals (e.g., cost savings, growth).
		-  *Risks – Potential challenges and mitigation strategies.
		-  *Resources Needed – People, funds, tools required.
    
6. **Tools for Program Management** 
    
	- *Dependency Diagrams* - (Physical and Technical dependencies between projects)
	    ex : Merger of a two organizations to form a new

7. **Benefit Management**
    
	- Ensures planned benefits (e.g., cost savings, efficiency) are actually achieved after implementing a change.
	
	- How It Works
		- Define the expected benefits from the program.
		- Analyze the balance between cost and benefit.
		- Plan how the benefits will be achieved and measured.
		- Allocate responsibilities for the successful delivery of the benefits.
		- Monitor the realization of the benefit
		
	- Types of Benefits
		- Mandatory compliance with Government regulations.
		- Quality of Service 
		- Productivity • More motivated workforce • Internal management benefits • Risk reduction • Economy • Revenue enhancement/acceleration • Strategic fit
	    
	- *Quantifying Benefits*
	
| Type                          | Description                                  | Example                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantified & Valued           | Measurable with monetary value assigned      | "Saves $50k/year in labor costs"                     |
| Quantified but Not Valued     | Numerically measured but no $ value          | "Customer satisfaction up 20%"                       |
| Identified but Not Quantified | Clear benefits without numerical measurement | "Improved brand reputation"                          |
| Non-Beneficial                | No positive impact (or negative effects)     | "New software increased training time without gains" |
	
- Test to clarify if the Benefit is genuine
    
	1. *"Can you explain why this benefit should result from this change?"*
	    
	    - Ensures the benefit is **directly linked** to the business change (not just assumed).
	    - Example: "Cost savings will come from automating Process X, reducing manual labor."
	    
	2. *"Can we see the consequences of this benefit?"*
	    
	    - Confirms the benefit is **observable/tangible** (not vague).
	    - Example: "Faster customer service will be visible via reduced complaint resolution time."
	    
	3. *"Could other factors explain the outcomes?"*
	    
	    - Tests if the benefit is **exclusively tied** to the change (no external influences).
	    - Example: "Sales increased, but was it due to our new system or a market trend?"
	        
	4. *"Can the benefits be measured?"*
	    
	    - Validates that the benefit is **quantifiable** (not subjective).
	    - Example: "Productivity gains will be tracked via output-per-hour metrics."

#### E. Project Planning
    
- An overall framework applied only for the project planning process and not monitoring or controlling the project.

0. **Select Project** 
	
	- Outside the main project planning process.
	- Projects that are of higher priority or more important to the business process are selected.
	- Usually managed through a Project Portfolio 
	
1. **Identify Project Scope & Objectives**
	
| **Step**                                         | **Explanation**                                                   | **Example**                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Identify Objectives and Practical Measures    | Define clear project goals and how success will be measured.      | Objective: Develop an online cake ordering system. Measure: 95% uptime, 100+ orders per month.   |
| 2. Establish Project Authority*                  | Assign a leader or manager responsible for decision-making.       | Project Manager: Tharaka leads the software team.                                                |
| 3. Stakeholder Analysis*                         | Identify all parties affected and their interests in the project. | Stakeholders: Customers (easy ordering), Bakery owner (profit), Developers (clear requirements). |
| 4. Modify Objectives Based on Stakeholder Input* | Adjust project goals to align with stakeholder needs.             | Add delivery tracking feature after discussing with customers.                                   |
| 5. Establish Communication Methods*              | Set up regular updates and clear channels for communication.      | Weekly Zoom meetings, WhatsApp group for daily updates.                                          |
	
2. **Identify Project Infrastructure**
	
| **Step**                                             | **Explanation**                                                                                         | **Example**                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Relationship Between Project & Strategic Planning | Ensure the project aligns with organizational strategies and complies with hardware/software standards. | A mobile app must use the company’s approved tech stack (e.g., React Native) and support digital transformation goals. |
| 2. Installation Standards & Procedures               | Define technical standards, change control, configuration management, and quality control.              | Use Git for version control, follow ISO 9001 quality standards, implement code review and CI/CD pipeline for releases. |
| 3. Project Team Organization                         | Determine how teams are structured and clarify roles based on organizational norms.                     | A matrix structure where Tharaka (Project Lead) coordinates with both development and QA teams.                        |
	
3. **Analyze Project Characteristics**
	
| **Step**                                             | **Explanation**                                                                        | **Example**                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Objective-Driven vs Product-Driven**            | Determine if the project focuses on achieving a goal or delivering a specific product. | Product-Driven: Develop a food delivery app. Objective-Driven: Reduce manual cake orders by 80%.          |
| **2. Analyse Other Characteristics**                 | Consider type and criticality of the system (e.g., safety-critical, IS).               | An online payment system is reliability-critical. A hospital monitoring system is safety-critical.        |
| **3. Identify High-Level Risks**                     | Recognize key risks from various domains (operational, technical, etc.).               | Risk: Developer unfamiliar with the selected framework; Risk: Unstable internet for cloud-based services. |
| **4. Consider User Requirements for Implementation** | Understand deployment or usage constraints from users.                                 | Users need offline access → App must have local caching.                                                  |
| **5. Select Development Methodology & Life Cycle**   | Choose appropriate development and lifecycle models.                                   | Agile for flexible changes; Waterfall for fixed and clearly defined requirements.                         |
| **6. Review Overall Resource Estimates**             | Adjust effort, budget, and timeline with updated understanding.                        | After analysis, add 2 more developers and extend timeline by 1 month due to new features.                 |
	
4. **Identify Project Products & Activities**
	
| **Step**                                       | **Explanation**                                                            | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Identify Project Products (Deliverables)    | Break down deliverables into system, module, and management products.      | **System:** Tested web portal  <br>**Module:** Login module code  <br>**Management:** Weekly progress reports                                                                                                                     |
| 2. Product Description                         | Describe each product in detail: name, purpose, composition, quality, etc. | **Product:** "Login Module"  <br>**Purpose:** Allow secure user access  <br>**Source:** Based on authentication spec  <br>**Form:** JavaScript code  <br>**Standard:** OWASP security  <br>**Quality:** No critical security bugs |
| 3. Document Generic Product Flows              | Create a product flow diagram showing the sequence of product development. | **Flow:** Requirements → Design → Code → Test (Top-to-Bottom or Left-to-Right diagram) - (image 1)                                                                                                                                |
| 3. Recognize Product Instances                 | Identify specific versions or occurrences of products.                     | v1.0 of "Order Processing Module" with basic payment integration                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4. Produce Ideal Activity Network              | Map activities that convert one product into another.                      | Activity: “Develop UI” transforms design mockup → functional UI - (image 2)                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1. Modify Ideal Network for Stages/Checkpoints | Adjust network for quality checks and realistic scheduling.                | Add stage: "Code Review" after "Develop UI" to ensure quality before testing                                                                                                                                                      |

5. **Estimate Effort for Each Activity**
	
	- Bottom-Up Estimation - Break down tasks into smaller subtasks to calculate effort, time, and non-staff resources.
	    
	- Revise Plan - Split large tasks into manageable subtasks for better monitoring.
    
6. **Identify Activity Risks**
	
| **Step**                                        | **Explanation**                                                                                | **Example**                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Identify and Quantify Activity-Based Risks   | Identify risks that may affect the success of individual activities and estimate their impact. | Risk: Client requirements unclear → Effort estimate: 3–6 weeks instead of fixed 4 weeks.                                     |
| 1. Plan Risk Reduction and Contingency Measures | Develop strategies to minimize risk and create backup plans in case risks occur.               | Risk Reduction: Conduct a requirement clarification session early.  <br>Contingency: Add 1 extra developer if delays happen. |
| 3. Adjust Overall Plans & Estimates             | Modify project schedules, resource plans, and cost estimates based on identified risks.        | Adjusted Plan: Add 2 buffer weeks to the project timeline and increase budget by 10%.                                        |
	  
7. **Allocate Resources**
	
	- Assign Resources - Distribute staff, tools, and budget to tasks.
	    
	- Revise Plans - Adjust timelines if resources are constrained.

8. **Review & Publicize Plan**
	
| **Step**                                      | **Explanation**                                                                        | **Example**                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Review quality aspects of the project plan | Ensure that each activity meets defined quality criteria before being marked complete  | Quality check: Code module must pass all unit tests and peer review before sign-off   |
| 2. Document plan and obtain agreement         | Finalize the project plan and get approval from all stakeholders to confirm commitment | Share plan with client and team, collect signatures or email confirmations to proceed |
	
9/10.  **Execute Plan & Lower-Level Planning**
	
| **Step**                                                                | **Explanation**                                                                          | **Example**                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Draw more detailed plans as the project progresses                   | Create detailed plans for upcoming phases when enough information is available           | After completing design, plan detailed coding and testing schedules                       |
| 2. Delay detailed planning of later stages until more info is available | Avoid over-planning early; wait for progress and feedback before finalizing later tasks  | Postpone detailed deployment plan until beta testing results are ready                    |
| 3. Make provisions for later tasks but finalize details later           | Allocate time and resources roughly for future tasks, refining plans as project advances | Reserve two weeks for user training, plan exact training content after software is stable |
  
#### F. Project Analysis
	
- ==Based on the 3rd step in the project planning.==
	
1. **Development Approaches**
    
	- *In-House Projects*
		- Developers belong to the same organization.
		- Follow organizational standards but can explore new techniques.
		
		 - Ex : A company develops its own internal HR management system using its standard coding practices but tries a new UI framework.
	    
		- The IT team builds a custom reporting tool for sales data, following company security policies but experimenting with cloud hosting.
	    
	- *External Development*
		- Requires review of methodologies (technical planning/method tailoring).
		
	    - Ex : A software firm outsources a mobile app to an external vendor who must follow strict delivery milestones and use approved project management methods.
	    
		- A government agency hires a contractor to develop a public website, requiring the contractor to submit detailed technical plans and adjust methodologies as requested.
		
	- *Key Considerations*
		
		- **Project Analysis**  
			- When external teams develop a project, their methods and technologies must be reviewed to fit client needs.  
			
			- Example: A company checks if the vendor's tools match their security policies.
			
		- **Technical Planning / Method Tailoring**  
			- Adapting development methods to suit the project.  
			
			- Example: Modifying Agile to include extra documentation for a government project.
			
		- **Means-End Inversion**  
			- Focusing more on procedures than actual goals.  
				
			- Example: Spending too long perfecting design docs, delaying real development.
			
		- **Project Environment Influence**  
			- The project's surroundings affect planning and execution.  
				
			- Example: A banking app must meet strict security and legal standards.
			  
	- *Build vs. Buy*
		
		- **Build** - More control (in-house/outsourced) but costly.
		    
		    - **In-House**: Internal team builds the system.  
		        Example: A company builds its own payroll system.
		        
		    - **Outsourced**: External firm develops it.  
		        Example: A university hires a firm for its student portal.
	        
		- **Buy** - Faster but less customizable (price/ maintenance/ ownership risk/ Trial & waiting period/ Maintenance and bugs etc./ Not competitive/ Limited customizability/ Ownership/ Reliance risks).
			
		    - Consider price, support, and customizability.  
		    - Example: A school buys ready-made software—cheap but less flexible and depends on the vendor.
	  
2. **Methodology Selection**
    
	- 
  

- Choose based on:
    

- Project Type (e.g., SSADM for info systems, Agile for speed).
    
- Team Skills (training needs or not).
    
- Environment (hardware/software constraints).
    

  

Affects - Staff training, hiring, hardware/software needs, and maintenance.

  

- Project Characteristics Identification
    

- Identify whether the project is Objective-Driven (flexible solutions) or Product-Driven (fixed deliverables).
    
- Is it data-oriented (e.g., database systems) or process-oriented (e.g., workflow automation)?
    
- Is it safety-critical (e.g., medical software)?
    
- Nature of the HW/SW environment.
    
- Is the SW general or application dependent?
    

  

3. Risk Management
    

  

- Risk Identification: Assess risks impacting task success (e.g., unclear client requirements).
    
- Mitigation Planning: Define actions to reduce risks and contingency plans.
    
- Adjust Plans: Update schedules/budgets based on risk analysis.
    

  

- High Risks: Unclear requirements, resource gaps, process flaws.
    
- Mitigation: Identify uncertainties early (e.g., prototyping).
    

  

- Areas of Uncertainty
    

- Product Uncertainty – Unclear or changing requirements.
    
- Process Uncertainty – Unpredictable workflows or methodologies.
    
- Resource Uncertainty – Unreliable staff, budget, or tools.
    
- Uncertainty vs. Complexity – Lack of info vs. interconnected tasks.
    

  

- Trade-offs
    

- Speed vs. Quality : Faster delivery → May reduce testing → More bugs.
    

       More testing → Better quality → Slower release.

  

4. ### Software Effort Estimation
    

A Successful Project: A Project that is delivered on time, within budget and with the required quality. Estimation is initially done at stage 5.

  

5. Difficulties in estimation
    

  

- Inherent Challenges
    

- Arise the Complexity and invisibility of software.
    
- Subjective nature of estimates.
    
- Varying scales (small vs. large tasks).
    
- Rapidly changing technologies.
    
- Inconsistent project experiences.
    

  

- Human/Political Factors.
    

- Budget constraints affecting accuracy
    
- Padding estimates for comfort zones
    
- Approval pressures influencing numbers
    

  

- Where Estimates Are Used
    

- Strategic Planning - Portfolio decisions
    
- Feasibility Studies - Cost/benefit analysis
    
- System Specification - Implementation effort
    
- Vendor Evaluation - Comparing supplier quotes
    
- Project Planning - Detailed Scheduling
    

  

6. Over & Under Estimation
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Concept|Description|Implication|
|Parkinson’s Law|"Work expands to fill the time available."|Overestimation leads to inefficiency (wasted time/resources).|
|Brooks’ Law|"Adding people to a late project makes it later."|More staff ≠ faster delivery (increased coordination overhead).|
|Underestimation Pros|Encourages efficiency and tight focus.|Motivates teams to avoid complacency.|
|Underestimation Cons|Risks quality (Weinberg’s Law: "Unreliable systems meet all non-reliability goals.").|Shortcuts may compromise reliability.|
|Psychological Impact|Achievable targets → Boost morale. Unrealistic deadlines → Demotivation.|Team performance tied to realistic goals.|
|Estimation Reality|A management tool (not a precise prediction).|±20% variance is acceptable (Bohem’s Rule).|

  

- By using historical data
    

- International Software Benchmarking Standard group (data from 4800 projects).
    

  

- Measure of work
    

- Use a general measure as, SLOC (Source Lines of Code), KLOC (Thousand Lines of Code)
    

  

7. Estimation Techniques 
    

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Technique|Brief Explanation|Example|
|Algorithmic Models|Uses mathematical formulas with inputs (size, complexity).|COCOMO: Effort = a × (KLOC)^b × drivers.|
|Expert Judgment|Relies on the experienced team's intuition.|Senior dev estimates 6 months based on past similar projects.|
|Analogy|Compared with past similar projects.|"This e-commerce app will take 20% longer than our last one."|
|Parkinson's Law|Work fills available time (not effort-based).|Allocating 3 months because that's the deadline, regardless of the actual effort needed.|
|Price to Win|Sets artificially low estimates to secure contracts.|Bidding <br><br>50kknowingitwillcost<br><br>50kknowingitwillcost80k to win the deal.|
|Top-Down|Starts with the total estimate, and divides it into components.|"Project = 1,000 hrs; Design = 300 hrs, Coding = 500 hrs..."|
|Bottom-Up|Sums estimates of small tasks for total effort.|"Login page = 40 hrs, DB setup = 30 hrs → Total = 70 hrs."|

9. ### Activity Planning
    

  

10. What is Activity Planning? 
    

  

- Creating a detailed schedule with,
    

- Start/end times for each task and
    
- Resource allocation (who does what, when).
    

  

Key Tools: Gantt charts, network diagrams (CPM/PERT).

  

- Benefits
    

- Resource Availability - Prevents conflicts.
    
- Progress Tracking - Compare planned vs. actual timelines.
    
- Cash Flow Management - Forecasts when funds are needed.
    

  

- Key Objectives
    

- Feasibility Check - "Can we deliver within 6 months with 5 developers?"
    
- Resource Optimization - "Assign senior devs to critical modules; juniors to documentation."
    
- Cost & Motivation - "Set weekly targets to keep the team motivated."
    
- Coordination - "Sync design and dev teams daily via stand-ups."
    

  

- When to Plan? (At stage 4-5)
    

- Feasibility Phase - Rough estimates (top-down).
    
- Project Kickoff - Detailed task breakdown (bottom-up).
    
- Ongoing - Adjust for delays (e.g., "Add buffer for bug fixes").
    

  

11. Project Schedules 
    

  

- 4 Steps to Create a Schedule
    

- List Activities in Order - Ideal plan (no constraints) : "Design → Code → Test → Deploy."
    
- Risk Analysis - Identify delays (e.g., "Testing may take longer if bugs are found.").
    
- Allocate Resources - Adjust for limits : "Only 1 QA tester available → extend testing timeline."
    
- Publish Schedule - Final output: Gantt chart/resource calendar.
    

  

- Scheduling is done using project activities. They have,
    

- Clear Start/End - Each task has a deliverable (e.g., "Prototype approved by Feb 1").
    
- Dependencies - Some tasks wait for others : "Coding can’t start until the design is approved."
    
- Resource Forecasts - Plan consistent resource use : "3 developers needed full-time for 4 weeks."
    

  

- Identifying Activities
    

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Approach|How It Works|Example|
|Activity-Based|List all tasks (Work Breakdown Structure).|"1. Requirements → 2. Design → 3. Code..."|
|Product-Based|Focus on deliverables (Product Breakdown Structure).|"UI Mockups → Database Schema → Test Reports"|
|Hybrid|Mix of both (WBS + deliverables).|"Design Phase → UI Mockups + Backend Specs"|

  
  

12. Sequencing and Scheduling 
    

  

- Project Plan based on,
    

- Consideration of which task precedes other tasks.
    
- The available resources.
    
- Ex: Bar Chart
    

  

- Network Planning models - These project scheduling techniques model the project’s activities and their relationships as a network
    

- Precedence Network
    
- CPM Network
    
- Activity-on-Arrow Network
