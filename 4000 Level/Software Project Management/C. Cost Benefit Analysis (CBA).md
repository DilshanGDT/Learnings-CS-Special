1. **What is CBA?**
    
	- Techniques to assess project viability through financial and risk analysis for Identify all of the costs and benefits of carrying out the project and operating the delivered application.
		- Ex - Development cost, Setup cost, Operational cost
    
	- ==All profitable projects cannot be done at the same time hence, we need to do a CBA to select the most profitable.==
    
	- *Costs*
		- Development cost: Hiring software engineers to build the app.
		- Setup cost: Purchasing servers for deployment.
		- Operational cost: Monthly cloud hosting fees.
    
	- *Benefits*
		- Quantified and valued: "$500K annual revenue increase from faster checkout."
		- Quantified but not valued: "Reduces support tickets by 30%."
		- Identified but not quantified/valued: "Improves brand reputation."
    
2. **Cash Flow Forecasting**
    
	- *Cash flow forecast* - Indicates when expenditure and income will take place.

3. **Cash Flow Metrices**
	
|Metric|Definition|Example|Why We Need This Metric|
|---|---|---|---|
|Net Profit|Revenue minus all expenses.|$100K sales − $70K costs = $30K profit.|Shows the actual profitability of a project or the overall portfolio.|
|Payback Period|Time to recover the initial investment.|Recoup $60K in 3 years.|Indicates how quickly the initial investment will be recouped, highlighting the project's liquidity.|
|ROI|Profit percentage relative to cost.|($20K gain / $50K cost) = 40% ROI.|Measures the efficiency of the investment, showing the return generated for every dollar invested.|
|NPV|Future cash flows' value minus initial cost.|NPV = $10K → Project viable.|Determines the present value of all future cash flows, indicating the project's potential to create value.|
|IRR|Break-even discount rate for NPV.|IRR = 15% (beats 10% benchmark).|Represents the rate of return at which the project's NPV is zero, used to compare against a company's cost of capital.|
	
4. **CB Evaluation Techniques**
    
	- *Problems of Cash Flows*
	    
		- It's not enough to look at the total profit or benefit; the timing of cash inflows and outflows matters.
		    
		- Example: Even if a project looks profitable in the long run, it might struggle with short-term cash flow problems, like not having enough money to pay interest on borrowed money.
		    
		- So, a good evaluation considers when money is needed and when it becomes available.
		
	- *Risk Analysis*
		
		- A project might have a positive CBA (benefits > costs), but if it involves high risk (like uncertainty in the market, political instability, or tech failure), it could fail in practice.
		    
		- Evaluating risks means checking how likely things are to go wrong and how serious the impact would be.
		    
		- It helps avoid over-relying on ideal outcomes and prepares for possible failures.
	    
	- *The Perspective of the Entire Organization*
	    
		- A project might benefit one department or function, but harm the overall financial health of the entire organization.
		    
		- So, evaluation should consider:
			- Does the organization have the resources?
			- Will it affect other critical operations?
			- Is it aligned with long-term goals?
    
5. **Risk Evaluation** 
    
	- A systematic process to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks that could impact a project’s success, focusing on both threats (negative risks) and opportunities (positive risks).
		
		- Business Risks - Uncertainty about whether the delivered product/service will be profitable.
		- Technical Risks: Bugs, scalability issues, or integration failures.
		- Operational Risks: Resource shortages or process inefficiencies.
		- Market Risks: Changing customer needs or competitor actions.
		- Financial Risks: Budget overruns or cash flow gaps.
	
6. **Risk Evaluation Techniques** 
	
	- *Project Risk Matrix* - Risk, Importance & Likelihood
	    
		![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd2MNHWH-R_zATr5k2bKdHNli4sThDodF399zObz1wDsFvxywFsTcsmRR0wmvvAndISrJ2WIO5Z50lFXjRlXRgVomfKmP9YZ1gVLt4So7fkfbJq7ou2AdLF7tO5YoQKkN6K5_MfDA?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
		
		==Likelihood refers to the probability that a specific risk will occur during the project. It’s a key component of risk evaluation, often rated on a scale (e.g., Low/Medium/High or 1-5).==
		
	- *Risk and NPV* - When a project is deemed highly risky, a higher discount rate is used (+2% safe project, +5% for a risky project)
		
		![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf7GtVP_oEe2SSn_BE8dROxHQ6F25_WbyOPGPMmUDwx6lPD4kZHPpZIHC4G6fTPh8m8C0cC2jO55m1794rEtgdVTRXQqprRbkXdfWcbQJzo7MnM8j20Qx2ULqnjmdiY9crxmIHk?key=0tlDoQZjntGxb90mUs_dN2MX)
		
		==A CBA considering each possible outcome and estimate the probability and the corresponding value of the outcome  ==
		
	- *Risk Profile Analysis*
	    
		- This is done by varying each of the parameters that affect cost or benefit to ascertain how sensitive the profit is to each factor (ex. By +/- 5%).
		    
		- Identify which parameters are most important and see how they can be controlled or their effects mitigated.
		    
		- Ex Scenario :
			- Replace Old sales order system : Rumor that a competitor will declare bankruptcy.
				
			- Extending the current system 
				- No expansion NPV 75000
				- Expansion NPV 100000 loss
				
			- Replacing current system
				- No Expansion NPV 50000 loss
				- Expansion NPV 250000
			    
			- Probability Expansion 20%, Not 80%
	    
		*Explanation* : This decision involves evaluating two options - extending the current system or replacing it, while considering market rumors (competitor bankruptcy) and expansion probabilities.
		
		Rumor: Competitor’s potential bankruptcy could reduce competition, creating expansion opportunities.
		
		Expansion Probability: 20% chance market expands (aggressive growth).
		
		80% chance no expansion (status quo).
		
		- *Decision tree*

		*Decision* 
		- Extend: (75,000 * 0.8 – 100,000 * 0.2) = 40,000 
		- Replace: (250,000 * 0.2 – 50,000 * 0.8) = 10,000
		- Extending the system has a higher expected value (+40Kvs.+10K), but replacement mitigates the risk if expansion occurs.
