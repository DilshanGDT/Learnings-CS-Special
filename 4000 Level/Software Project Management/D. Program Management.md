1. **What are Program & Program Management?**
    
	- A *program* is a group of related projects and initiatives managed together to achieve strategic benefits that wouldn’t be possible if managed individually.
	
	  - *Program management* he coordinated management of multiple projects to deliver strategic value, optimize resources, and manage risks across the program.
	
2. **Forms of Programs**
	
| Program Type              | Description                                                          | Example                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Cycle Programmes | Projects within a fixed planning period (e.g., annual budget cycle). | A retail chain’s yearly store upgrades and marketing campaigns. |
| Strategic Programmes      | Projects driving a unified strategic goal.                           | Merging two banks’ IT systems post-acquisition.                 |
| Infrastructure Programmes | Shared infrastructure supporting multiple projects/departments.      | A cloud migration for all company divisions.                    |
| R&D Programmes            | Mix of high-risk and safe projects for innovation.                   | Pharma companies test 10 drug candidates (1-2 may succeed).     |
| Innovative Partnerships   | Cross-organization collaboration on pre-competitive tech.            | Tech giants jointly develop AI ethics frameworks.               |
	
3. **Resource Allocation Management**
    
	- *Resource Sharing*
		
		- Pools of resources must be shared between concurrent projects.
		- Ex : Software Developers, database designers, network support staff, systems analysts
	
| Aspect                      | Project Manager                         | Programme Manager                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of Projects          | Manages one project at a time.          | Manages multiple projects simultaneously.            |
| Relationship with Resources | Impersonal (focuses on resource types). | Personal (works closely with skilled resources).     |
| Resource Focus              | Minimizes demand (avoids overuse).      | Maximizes utilization (optimizes shared resources).  |
| Project Similarity          | Projects are dissimilar (unique goals). | Projects are similar (aligned to a common strategy). |
	
4. **Strategic Program Management** 
    
	- Coordinated management of multiple projects to achieve long-term organizational goals.
	-  Ex - Large complex organizations
		
	- Creating a Program with 4 stages...
	
| Stage                | Purpose                             | Key Components                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Programme Mandate | Formalize strategic intent.         | - New capabilities/services.<br><br>- Organizational improvements.<br><br>- Corporate alignment. | "Launch AI-driven customer service to reduce response time by 40% by 2025."    |
| 2. Programme Brief   | Justify investment (business case). | - Vision statement.<br><br>- Benefits & metrics.<br><br>- Risks, costs, timelines.               | "AI implementation costs 1M but will save 300K/year in staffing costs."        |
| 3. Vision Statement  | Define detailed direction.          | - Specific capabilities.<br><br>- Performance indicators.<br><br>- Team responsibilities.        | "All departments will use AI tools, with 95% accuracy KPIs tracked quarterly." |
| 4. Blueprint         | Plan operational execution.         | - Process changes.<br><br>- Staffing/IT needs.<br><br>- Data requirements.                       | "Hire 3 AI specialists, upgrade servers, and train staff by Q2 2025."          |
	
5. **Preliminary Program Plan**
	
	- A set of related projects and initiatives aimed at achieving strategic business objectives.
		
	- Not usually possible to have an exact plan at the program onset.
	    
	- Would include : 
		- *No Exact Early Plan* – Programs are complex, so detailed planning happens gradually.
		- *Project Portfolio* – List of projects under the program.
		- *Cost Estimates – Rough budget for each project.
		-  *Expected Benefits – Goals (e.g., cost savings, growth).
		-  *Risks – Potential challenges and mitigation strategies.
		-  *Resources Needed – People, funds, tools required.
    
6. **Tools for Program Management** 
    
	- *Dependency Diagrams* - (Physical and Technical dependencies between projects)
	    ex : Merger of a two organizations to form a new

	- *Delivery Planning* - Typically leads to ‘tranches’. Tranche is a group of projects that will deliver their products as one step in the program.

7. **Benefit Management**
    
	- Ensures planned benefits (e.g., cost savings, efficiency) are actually achieved after implementing a change.
	
	- How It Works
		- Define the expected benefits from the program.
		- Analyze the balance between cost and benefit.
		- Plan how the benefits will be achieved and measured.
		- Allocate responsibilities for the successful delivery of the benefits.
		- Monitor the realization of the benefit
		
	- Types of Benefits
		- Mandatory compliance with Government regulations.
		- Quality of Service 
		- Productivity • More motivated workforce • Internal management benefits • Risk reduction • Economy • Revenue enhancement/acceleration • Strategic fit
	    
	- *Quantifying Benefits*
	
| Type                          | Description                                  | Example                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Quantified & Valued           | Measurable with monetary value assigned      | "Saves $50k/year in labor costs"                     |
| Quantified but Not Valued     | Numerically measured but no $ value          | "Customer satisfaction up 20%"                       |
| Identified but Not Quantified | Clear benefits without numerical measurement | "Improved brand reputation"                          |
| Non-Beneficial                | No positive impact (or negative effects)     | "New software increased training time without gains" |
	
- Test to clarify if the Benefit is genuine
    
	1. *"Can you explain why this benefit should result from this change?"*
	    
	    - Ensures the benefit is **directly linked** to the business change (not just assumed).
	    - Example: "Cost savings will come from automating Process X, reducing manual labor."
	    
	2. *"Can we see the consequences of this benefit?"*
	    
	    - Confirms the benefit is **observable/tangible** (not vague).
	    - Example: "Faster customer service will be visible via reduced complaint resolution time."
	    
	3. *"Could other factors explain the outcomes?"*
	    
	    - Tests if the benefit is **exclusively tied** to the change (no external influences).
	    - Example: "Sales increased, but was it due to our new system or a market trend?"
	        
	4. *"Can the benefits be measured?"*
	    
	    - Validates that the benefit is **quantifiable** (not subjective).
	    - Example: "Productivity gains will be tracked via output-per-hour metrics."
