### **Task #2: Full Title-Wise Analysis**

#### **1. Title & Authors**

- **Title**: _Scaling Memcache at Facebook_
    
- **Authors**: Facebook engineering team (Rajesh Nishtala et al.).
    
- **Context**: Memcached is an open-source, in-memory key-value store. Facebook scaled it to handle trillions of items and billions of requests/sec.
    

#### **2. Key Problem Statement**

Facebook’s social graph demands:

- **Low-latency** access to shared data (e.g., posts, likes).
    
- **High throughput** (millions of requests/sec).
    
- **Consistency** while tolerating stale data for performance.
    
- **Scalability** across geographically distributed clusters.
    

#### **3. Core Logic/Approach**

Facebook’s system is a **distributed caching layer** built atop memcached, with enhancements:

- **Three-tier architecture**: Web servers → Memcached clusters → Databases.
    
- **Consistency model**: Best-effort eventual consistency (invalidations via deletes).
    
- **Optimizations**:
    
    - **Leases**: Prevent thundering herds and stale sets.
        
    - **Gutter pools**: Handle failures by redirecting requests to backup servers.
        
    - **Regional pools**: Balance replication vs. memory efficiency.
        
    - **Cold Cluster Warmup**: Accelerate cache recovery after failures.
        

#### **4. Use Cases & Applications**

- **Demand-filled look-aside cache**:
    
    - **Read path**: Web servers check memcache before querying databases.
        
    - **Write path**: Databases invalidate cached data after updates.
        
- **Generic key-value store**: Stores precomputed ML results, session data, etc.
    
- **Geographic replication**: Reduces latency for global users.
    

#### **5. Strengths/Weaknesses**

- **Strengths**:
    
    - **Scalability**: Handles Facebook’s massive workload.
        
    - **Fault tolerance**: Gutter pools mitigate cascading failures.
        
    - **Performance**: UDP for gets, batching, and parallel requests reduce latency.
        
- **Weaknesses**:
    
    - **Eventual consistency**: Stale data possible during replication lag.
        
    - **Complexity**: Requires careful tuning (e.g., lease rates, pool sizing).
        

#### **6. Examples & Analogies**

- **Leases**: Like a "token" system at a deli counter—only one customer (web server) can update the cache at a time.
    
- **Gutter pools**: Similar to emergency lanes on highways—diverts traffic when main lanes (memcached servers) fail.

### **Task #1: Group-Wise Explanations**

#### **Group 1: Explicit – Logic of the Paper**

- **Core Logic**: Memcache acts as a **look-aside cache**.
    
    - **Reads**: Cache hit → return data; miss → fetch from DB and populate cache.
        
    - **Writes**: Update DB → invalidate cache (delete).
        
- **Consistency**: Best-effort via invalidations; leases arbitrate concurrent writes.
    
- **Scalability**: Partitioning (consistent hashing), replication, and regional pools.
    

#### **Group 2: Explicit – Use Cases and Applications**

- **Social media feeds**: Aggregating posts/comments with low latency.
    
- **Machine learning**: Storing precomputed recommendations.
    
- **Geographic distribution**: Reducing latency for users in Asia/EU by caching locally.
    
- **Example**: A user’s newsfeed fetches 500+ keys from memcache; misses trigger DB queries.
    

#### **Group 3: Analyze the Logic – Reasoning**

- **Trade-offs**:
    
    - **Stale data**: Accepted for performance (e.g., 10-sec lease cooldown).
        
    - **UDP vs. TCP**: UDP reduces latency but drops 0.25% of requests (treated as misses).
        
- **Critique**:
    
    - **Complexity**: Gutter pools add operational overhead.
        
    - **Replication lag**: Remote markers mitigate but don’t eliminate stale reads.
        

#### **Group 4: Assess the Logic – Add Your Knowledge**

- **CAP Theorem**: Facebook prioritizes **Availability & Partition Tolerance** over strict Consistency.
    
- **Modern alternatives**: Compare with Redis (persistence) or DynamoDB (stronger consistency).
    
- **Improvements**:
    
    - **Adaptive leases**: Dynamic cooldown based on load.
        
    - **ML-driven pooling**: Automate pool sizing based on access patterns.
        

#### **Group 5: Create – Critical Thinking & Creativity**

- **Idea 1**: **"Smart Invalidation"**
    
    - Use ML to predict which keys need proactive invalidations.
        
- **Idea 2**: **"Edge Caching"**
    
    - Extend memcache to CDN edges for faster global access.
        
- **Idea 3**: **"Consistency Tuning API"**
    
    - Let apps choose consistency levels per key (e.g., "strong" for payments, "weak" for likes).

### **Key Takeaways for Exams**

1. **Memcache ≠ Database**: It’s a cache—no persistence, but reduces DB load.
    
2. **Trade-offs**: Performance vs. consistency, memory vs. replication.
    
3. **Scale tricks**: Batching, leases, and stateless clients simplify scaling.
