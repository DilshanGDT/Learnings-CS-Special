### C. Brief Summary:

The paper presents the **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)**, a method for extracting and matching distinctive image features invariant to scale, rotation, and partial affine distortion. SIFT involves four main stages: detecting scale-space extrema, localizing key points, assigning orientations, and generating descriptors. These features are highly distinctive, enabling reliable matching across large databases. The paper also describes applications in object recognition, including clustering key points with the Hough transform and verifying matches using least-squares pose estimation. SIFT achieves robustness to noise, occlusion, and illumination changes, making it suitable for real-time recognition tasks.

### D. Main Methods and Brief Explanations:

1. **Scale-space extrema detection**:
	
    - Uses the **difference-of-Gaussian (DoG)** function to identify potential key points across scales.
    - Efficiently approximates the Laplacian of Gaussian, which is optimal for scale invariance.

2. **Keypoint localization**:
	
    - Fits a 3D quadratic function to interpolate the exact location and scale of key points.
    - Rejects low-contrast points and edges using the **Hessian matrix** to ensure stability.

3. **Orientation assignment**:
	
    - Computes gradient magnitudes and orientations within a key point's neighborhood.
    - Assigns dominant orientations using a histogram, enabling rotation invariance.

4. **Keypoint descriptor**:
	
    - Constructs a **128-dimensional vector** from gradient orientations in a 4x4 grid around the key point.
    - Normalizes the vector to achieve illumination invariance and thresholds values to reduce noise sensitivity.

5. **Matching and recognition**:
	
    - Uses **nearest-neighbor search** (with Best-Bin-First algorithm) to match descriptors in a database.
    - Filters matches by comparing distances to the closest and second-closest neighbors.
    - Applies the **Hough transform** to cluster key points agreeing on an object's pose, followed by affine transformation verification.
